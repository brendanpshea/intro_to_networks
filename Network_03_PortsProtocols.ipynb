Known to friends as **SMB**, this sociable soul has been helping computers share their files and printers since the earliest days of networks. Making its home primarily at **Port 445 (TCP)** - though in younger days it also frolicked with NetBIOS at ports 137-139 - SMB has quite a tale to tell about its journey from simple file-sharing to becoming a secure and sophisticated protocol.\n",
