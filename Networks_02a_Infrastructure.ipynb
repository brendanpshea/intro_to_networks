        "\n",
        "When you type a website address into your browser, your computer typically makes a direct connection to that site. But in many organizations, there's something in the middle: a **proxy server**. Like a personal assistant handling your mail, a proxy server receives your requests, makes those requests on your behalf, and then delivers the responses back to you. This simple idea - being an intermediary - makes proxy servers powerful tools for security, performance, and control.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's look at the three main types of proxy servers through real-world examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Forward Proxy\n",
        "   Think of this like a personal shopper. You give them your shopping list, and they go to the stores for you. The stores only see the shopper, not you.\n",
        "   - Your computer asks the proxy to get www.example.com\n",
        "   - The proxy makes the request using its own address\n",
        "   - The website sees the proxy's address, not yours\n",
        "   - Common in schools and businesses for controlling internet access\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Reverse Proxy\n",
        "   This works more like a receptionist. Visitors don't get your direct office number; they talk to the receptionist who then connects them to you.\n",
        "   - External users try to reach your company's web server\n",
        "   - They connect to the proxy instead\n",
        "   - The proxy forwards valid requests to the actual server\n",
        "   - Commonly used by websites to protect their servers\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Transparent Proxy\n",
        "   Imagine an automatic door that opens for you - you might not even know it's there, but it's controlling your path.\n",
        "   - Users don't know they're using a proxy\n",
        "   - No configuration needed on user devices\n",
        "   - Often used for content filtering\n",
        "   - Common in public WiFi hotspots\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's what happens when you try to visit a website through each type of proxy.\n",
        "\n",
        "| Step | Forward Proxy | Reverse Proxy | Transparent Proxy |\n",
        "|------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|\n",
        "| 1. Request | You → Proxy | You → What you think is the server | You → Internet |\n",
        "| 2. Processing | Proxy checks if allowed | Proxy receives request | Proxy intercepts automatically |\n",
        "| 3. Forwarding | Proxy → Website | Proxy → Real server | Proxy → Website |\n",
        "| 4. Response | Website → Proxy → You | Server → Proxy → You | Website → Proxy → You |\n",
        "\n",
        "Proxy servers can do many useful things with this middle position.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Content Filtering\n",
        "   - A school blocks social media during class hours\n",
        "   - A business prevents access to malicious websites\n",
        "   - A library filters inappropriate content\n",
