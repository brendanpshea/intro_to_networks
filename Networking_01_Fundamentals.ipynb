Or how millions of devices can communicate simultaneously across the internet without descending into chaos? Computer networking may seem like magic, but it's actually a carefully orchestrated symphony of protocols and processes, each playing its part in the grand performance of digital communication.\n",

Think of it as the blueprint that network engineers use to understand, troubleshoot, and build the networks we rely on every day. By breaking down network communications into seven distinct layers, the OSI model helps us manage the complexity of modern networking one piece at a time.\n",

        "Understanding the Physical Layer is crucial because it defines the basic building blocks that make all higher-level network functions possible. When network engineers talk about \"signal degradation,\" \"noise interference,\" or \"bandwidth limitations,\" they're discussing Physical Layer concerns.

        "\n",
        "2. **IP Header Details**:\n",
        "   - **tos**: `0x0`, referring to the **Type of Service** field (unused here).\n",
        "   - **ttl**: `64`, the **Time-to-Live**, which limits how many hops this packet can take before being discarded.\n",
        "   - **id**: `47473`, a unique identifier for this packet.\n",
        "   - **flags**: `[DF]`, which stands for “Don’t Fragment,” meaning the packet should not be split.\n",
        "   - **proto**: `TCP (6)`, indicating this is a **TCP packet**.\n",
