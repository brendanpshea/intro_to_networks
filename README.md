## ðŸ“– Chapters

### [Introduction to Networking and the OSI Model](./Networks_01_Intro_and_OSI.ipynb)
This chapter introduces the fundamental principles of **networking** and the **OSI model**. It explains the different layers of the OSI model, their roles, and how data flows through a network.

### [Network Architecture](./Networks_02_Architecture.ipynb)
This chapter explores **cloud networking** and its evolution. It introduces **Network Functions Virtualization (NFV)** and **Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs)**, explaining how modern enterprises move from traditional infrastructure to scalable cloud-based networks.

### [Ports and Protocols](./Networks_03_Ports_and_Protocols.ipynb)
This chapter discusses **network protocols** like TCP and UDP through a practical example: sending climate data across networks. It introduces **ports** as numerical identifiers directing network traffic and explains their role in communication.

### [Network Topologies](./Networks_04_Topologies.ipynb)
This chapter explains **physical and logical network topologies**, comparing different configurations such as bus, ring, and mesh networks. It includes an example of a **banana-processing facility** and how their network is structured.

### [IPv4 and Modern Networks](./Networks_05_IPv4andModernNetworks.ipynb)
This chapter introduces **IPv4 addressing**, subnetting, and how modern networks handle IP allocation. It covers **CIDR notation**, private and public IPs, and strategies for efficient network addressing.

### [Routing and Switching](./Networks_06_Routing_and_Switching.ipynb)
This chapter introduces **routing** and **switching** as the core components of modern networks. It explains how routers determine the best paths for data transmission and how switches facilitate communication within networks.

### [WiFi and Wireless Infrastructure](./Networks_07_WiFi_and_Infra.ipynb)
This chapter explores **WiFi standards** and their evolution. It examines how wireless networks have developed from early **802.11 protocols** to modern high-speed connections and discusses **Toad City Teaching Hospital** as a case study in upgrading network infrastructure.

### [Network Monitoring](./Networks_08_NetworkMonitoring.ipynb)
This chapter explains **network monitoring**, why it is crucial, and how organizations use monitoring tools to prevent downtime, enhance security, and maintain performance. It discusses **network outages** and their financial impact.

### [Network Administration](./Networks_09_NetworkAdmin.ipynb)
This chapter covers **network administration** tasks, including managing users, configuring routers and switches, and ensuring network security. It introduces common tools used by administrators to maintain large-scale networks.

### [IP Addressing and VPNs](./Networks_10_IPs_and_VPNs.ipynb)
This chapter discusses **IP addressing**, the difference between public and private IPs, and how **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)** enhance security and privacy in modern networks.

### [Network Security Fundamentals](./Networks_11_SecurityFundamentals.ipynb)
This chapter introduces key **network security concepts**, including **encryption, firewalls, intrusion detection systems**, and how organizations protect their infrastructure from cyber threats.

### [Network Attacks and Defense Strategies](./Networks_12_Attacks_and_Defense.ipynb)
This chapter focuses on **cybersecurity threats**, explaining common **network attacks** such as **DDoS, MITM, phishing, and malware infections**. It also covers defense strategies and security best practices.


This repository is designed for **students, educators, and self-learners** who want to develop a strong foundation in networking. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
