        "   - Lets you use your keyboard and mouse to control it\n",
        "   - Plays sounds from the remote computer\n",
        "   - Lets you use your local printer with remote programs\n",
        "   - Shares your clipboard between computers\n",

        "RDP uses clever tricks to make everything feel smooth and fast:\n",
        "- It remembers parts of the screen it's shown before\n",
        "- It sends rough images first, then adds details\n",
        "- It adjusts quality based on your internet speed\n",
        "\n",
        "To keep everything safe, RDP has special security features:\n",
        "- **Network Level Authentication (NLA)**: Checks who you are before letting you connect\n",
        "- **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**: Keeps all your data private and secure\n",
        "\n",
        "A word of caution: Like any powerful tool, RDP needs to be used carefully. Some important safety tips:\n",
        "- Always use strong passwords\n",
        "- Don't leave RDP open to the whole internet\n",
        "- Use a VPN when connecting from outside your network\n",

        "\n",
        "Think of ICMP as the network's town crier and troubleshooter. Unlike our other protocols who carry messages between applications, ICMP's job is to shout about network problems and help test if paths are working.\n",

        "1. Computer A sends an \"Echo Request\" to Computer B\n",
        "2. If Computer B is there and working, it sends back an \"Echo Reply\"\n",
        "3. Computer A can then say \"The round trip took X milliseconds!\"\n",

        "But ICMP does much more than ping. It also delivers these important messages:\n",
        "- \"Sorry, that computer isn't available!\" (Destination Unreachable)\n",
        "- \"Your package took too long to deliver!\" (Time Exceeded)\n",
        "- \"There's a better way to get there!\" (Redirect)\n",
        "\n",
        "When you use the `traceroute` command (or `tracert` on Windows), you're using ICMP's Time Exceeded messages to discover the path your packets take through the network. Each router along the way sends back a message saying \"I handled your packet!\"\n",

        "This might sound careless, but it's perfect for certain tasks:\n",
        "- DNS uses UDP because a quick answer is better than no answer\n",

        "Having met our core protocols (ICMP, TCP, and UDP), let us now explore how packets can travel secretly and safely across the dangerous open Internet. Just as medieval merchants needed safe passage through foreign lands, our modern data needs protected paths across the public network.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of **GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation)** as a master tunnel builder. When two networks need to talk across the Internet while pretending they're directly connected, GRE creates a virtual tunnel between them. It's like building a secret underground passage between two castles, allowing messages to pass unseen through intervening lands.\n",
        "\n",
        "The process of GRE tunneling follows these essential steps:\n",
        "1. Take the original packet\n",
        "2. Wrap it in a new packet (like putting a letter in a new envelope)\n",
        "3. Send it through the tunnel to the other end\n",
        "4. Unwrap it at the destination\n",
        "\n",
        "This simple but effective tunneling makes GRE perfect for connecting private networks across the Internet, but it has one significant limitation - it doesn't protect the traffic. For that, we need IPSec.\n",
        "\n",
        "**IPSec (Internet Protocol Security)** combines the roles of master guard and master spy, protecting messages while verifying their authenticity. It offers two main security components:\n",
        "\n",
        "| Component | Function |\n",
        "|-----------|-----------|\n",
        "| Authentication Header (AH) | Data integrity and origin authentication |\n",
        "| Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) | Encryption and optional authentication |\n",
        "\n",
        "IPSec uses **Internet Key Exchange (IKE)** to establish and maintain security associations between hosts. These security relationships determine how the traffic will be protected. For the actual protection of data, IPSec can operate in one of two modes:\n",
        "\n",
        "| Mode | Protection |\n",
        "|------|------------|\n",
        "| Transport Mode | Protects payload only |\n",
        "| Tunnel Mode | Protects entire original packet |\n",
        "\n",
        "When GRE and IPSec work together, they create secure pathways across the Internet. The wise administrator needs to know these key principles:\n",
        "1. Configure GRE for basic tunneling\n",
        "2. Apply IPSec for security\n",
        "3. Maintain proper key management\n",
        "4. Monitor tunnel health\n",
        "\n",

This is how most of our familiar protocols communicate - HTTP sends web pages to specific browsers, SMTP delivers email to specific mail servers, and SSH connects to specific remote computers.\n",
        "\n",

When you browse their website, your computer has a private unicast conversation with their web server: your computer politely requests each page, and the server responds directly to you, like a shopkeeper giving personal attention to each customer.\n",

        "### Multicast and Anycast: The Selective Messengers\n",
        "\n",
        "Multicast serves as a middle ground between personal messages and public announcements. Think of it as sending an invitation to a specific group - only members receive the message, but it's more efficient than sending individual copies. This makes multicast perfect for streaming video, online gaming, and team communications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Anycast, meanwhile, works more like a chain of stores - customers don't care which specific branch they visit, they just want the nearest one that can help. The DNS system cleverly uses this approach with its root servers. While we speak of \"13 root servers,\" each one actually represents hundreds of computers worldwide, and your requests automatically go to the nearest one.\n",

        "| Anycast | One-to-Nearest | DNS, CDNs | Automatic load distribution |\n",
        "\n",
        "The wise network designer chooses their traffic type carefully based on their specific needs. Most everyday communication uses unicast, but when you need to reach groups efficiently or distribute load across multiple servers, the other types become invaluable tools in your networking toolbox.\n",
        "\n",
        "And so our packets travel through the network realm, each finding its own best path to its destination. Whether through private conversations, public announcements, group messages, or nearest-neighbor delivery, every packet eventually finds its way home."
